TipCalculator
=============

Codepath - HW1 - Tip Calculator

How many hours did it take to complete?
It took about 1.5 - 2 hours to just get the basic stories done and another 2.5-3 hours to play around with the optional stories.


Completed Stories:
 - User is displayed the tip of specified percentage for specified entered amount
 - User enters the total amount of the transaction
 - User can select between tip amounts (i.e 10%, 15%, 20%)
 - Upon selecting tip amount, formatted tip value is displayed
 - (Optional) User changes the total amount and updated tip is reflected automatically
 - (Optional) User can select custom tip amount if desired
 - (Optional) Experiment with trying input widgets to replace the buttons and/or textviews
 - (Optional) Improve the user interface and experience by using images or colors!

I kept the versions of my app in two different branches. The main branch contains the basic requirements and some optional stories. experimentA branch is the branch I played around with after I completed the basic requirements
